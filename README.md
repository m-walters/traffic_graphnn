# traffic_graphnn
Graph Neural Network for traffic prediction

See my repo `traffic_graphnn_toy` for a proof-of-concept version of this.

The input datasets for this is proprietary.
Email me at `michaelwalters3000@gmail.com` if you are curious about data formatting.
`graphtools.py` references a file `hwy_pts.csv`, which is also not included here, but is a csv of lat/long coordinate pairs.

Needless to say, this is not an out-of-the-box product!
